    So you're interrested in who I am. Let me tell you a bit about myself. My name is Rick Poell and I am confident in my coding skills, as well as my ability to learn.
    I mainly use the code languages c#, css, html, css and php. I have created some fun projects in visual studio and studio code, as well as in unity.
    One of my ambitions is to bring joy to people who'll play games I have worked on, as well as to have the possibilitiy to create te game I have always wanted.
    My dad codes for his job and when I was a lot younger I was always interrested in what it all meant, because I only saw some line of words, number and symbols.
    This curiosity helped me later on to look into coding and how it all worked. I still find it fasinating how I am now able to read the meaning of what he's writes whenever I get the chance to look at his work.
