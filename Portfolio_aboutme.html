    So you're interrested in who I am. Let me tell you a bit about myself. My name is Rick Poell and I am confident in my coding skills, as well as my ability to learn.
    I mainly use the code languages c#, css, html, css and php. I have created some fun projects in visual studio and studio code, as well as in unity.
    One of my ambitions is to bring joy to people who'll play games I have worked on, as well as to have the possibilitiy to create te game I have always wanted.
