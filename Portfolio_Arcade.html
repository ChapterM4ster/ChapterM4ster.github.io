    One of my projects I am most proud of is Eggventures in space. Even though it wasn't the first game I had made, it was the first one where I could say I was happy with the end result.
    This has also been my biggest project (so far) using the unity engine.
 </p>
 
 <p class="text">
    The game is a PVP game where one player controls the U.F.O. and the other controls the bird. The goal is the shoot at on another until either one person reaches 0 hit points or until the U.F.O. reaches the top
    The U.F.O. wins if the bird reaches 0 hit points or reaches the top and if the U.F.O. reaches 0 hit points the bird wins. The game was made with it being an acrade game in mind.
    This resulted in a this game where two people try to beat one another with different advantages.
 </p>

 <p class="text">
    There are mayor differces in the two playable options. The biggest one are the different attacks. While the bird only has one attack the U.F.O. has four.
    The U.F.O. has the abillity to shoot out a stunning attack that deals no damage, a laser that deals three damage on hit and 3 damage if the bird keeps moving inside the laser, a single shot attack with a fast rate of fire dealing one damage on hit and the triple shot which has a decent rate of fire and also deals 1 damage.
    The bird on the other hand has only one attack, which deals 1 damage.
 </p>

 <p class="text">
     So it might seem like the U.F.O. has the upperhand here and in some way that's true, but the bird also has its advantages.
     for example its smaller hit box and  a lot more speed. The bird is has a much smaller hitbox when it compared to the U.F.O. and has much greater speed.
     This can result into the bird being capable of dodging some/most attacks, but being smaller and faster comes with another price. The U.F.O has a lot more health points.
 </p>

<p class="text">
    So even though the Bird is able to dodge attacks its health points is a lot less, 10 hit points to be precise. There are some pickups for the bird to increase its health by 3 but when the other player has become the bullet hell, those pickups might not always seem worth grabbing.
    But the U.F.O. can't heal itself during the game and since it is a much slower and bigger target, I decided to give it more health, A lot more health.
    The U.F.O. has a giant 100 hit points and doesn't go down withouth a fight, but being a big and slow moving target means getting hit almost 100% of the time.
